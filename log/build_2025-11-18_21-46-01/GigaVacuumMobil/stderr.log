  By not providing "Findcleaning_planner.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "cleaning_planner", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cleaning_planner"
  with any of the following names:

    cleaning_plannerConfig.cmake
    cleaning_planner-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cleaning_planner" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "cleaning_planner_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "cleaning_planner" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
